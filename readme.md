##READMEThis folder contains data files associated with a transcriptomic analysis of C3 and CAM <i>Erycina</i> (Orchidaceae) species (https://doi.org/10.1101/431460). The "counts.matrix" and "TPM.matrix" files are raw read count and TPM normalized read counts for <i>E. pusilla</i> ("ep") and <i>E. crista-galli</i> ("ecg"), respectively. The "annotations.txt" files are the annotations of the significantly time-structured transcripts (assessed by maSigPro) in each of the two species. Annotations are based on transcript orthogroup assignment and the TAIR10 annotation of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genes within that orthogroup. Please see the /OrthoSort and /Timecourse-RNA github repos for information on orthogroup sorting and analysis of transcripts with maSigPro, respectively. Updated 1/18/2019.
